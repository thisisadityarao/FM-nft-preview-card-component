## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learned Tailwind CSS! This was the first project where I make use of Tailwind CSS. It took more time than it would have writing just plain css, but since it was my first project using tailwind, time was well utilized. I learned a lot in this single project. `:hover` states, overlay effect, using flex and grid utility classes, setting font styles and spacing using utility classes, and so much more.

### Continued development

To get the hang of tailwind, I'll be doing more challenges/projects using tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The only resource I used to learn tailwind. Just search anything you want to know more about.
